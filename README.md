# Welcome to a Pokedex
This project involves building a command-line Pokedex using Golang and the Pok√©API. The tool fetches data about Pokemon and presents it in a CLI environment.
Learning Goals:
- Parse JSON data in Go
- Make HTTP GET requests using Go
- Build a CLI tool for interacting with APIs
- Get hands-on experience with Go development and tooling
- Understand and implement caching for better performance

## Ideas for Extending the Project

You don't have to extend this project, but if you're planning to make this something you add to your personal portfolio, you should consider making it your own by adding to it. Here are just a few ideas.

1. [ ] Update the CLI to support the "up" arrow to cycle through previous commands
2. [ ] Simulate battles between pokemon
3. [ ] Add more unit tests
4. [ ] Refactor your code to organize it better and make it more testable
5. [ ] Keep pokemon in a "party" and allow them to level up
6. [ ] Allow for pokemon that are caught to evolve after a set amount of time
7. [ ] Persist a user's Pokedex to disk so they can save progress between sessions
8. [ ] Use the PokeAPI to make exploration more interesting. For example, rather than typing the names of areas, maybe you are given choices of areas and just type "left" or "right"
9. [ ] Random encounters with wild pokemon
10. [ ] Adding support for different types of balls (Pokeballs, Great Balls, Ultra Balls, etc), which have different chances of catching pokemon
